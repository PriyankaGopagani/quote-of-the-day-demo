# Inspirational Quote Web App

## Overview
A minimal single-page web app that fetches and displays a random inspirational quote from the Quotable API (https://api.quotable.io/random). It loads a quote on startup and includes a button to fetch a new one.

## Setup
No build tools required.
- Save the provided index.html file.
- Open index.html in any modern web browser with internet access.

## Usage
- Open index.html.
- The app automatically fetches and displays an inspirational quote.
- Click the "New Quote" button to fetch another quote.
- If the inspirational filter fails, the app falls back to a general random quote. Errors are displayed unobtrusively and you can try again.
